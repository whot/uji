# Top-level YAML entries must contain a type: tag
# that specifies the type of the entry.
#
# Reserved keywords:
#   version: <int>
#      The file format version. This must be a top-level section. Where
#      include directives are present, all included files must have the same
#      version. Where missing, the version number is 1.
#
#   include: path/to/file
#      Includes the given file with the path relative to the current file.
#      Inclusion is in situ, i.e. the location of the include directive
#      matters.

#     A section that describes the file itself. This description will be

# The actor type is an entity that a test is performed on.
# Allowed subkeys:
#    extends: inherit all from the referenced section
#    name: a human-readable name for the entity
#    description: a longer description for human consumption
#    tags: a dictionary of key: value that can be used to filter on
#          value must not be a list/dict
#  
# The test type is a description of a test that may produce log files.
# Allowed subkeys:
#    extends: inherit all from the referenced section
#    name: a human-readable name for the test
#    description: a longer description for human consumption
#    filter: a dictionary to filter on. All keys+values of the actor must
#            match the entries in this dictionary.
#            The value must be a list, even if it's just one entry
#            Where the filter tag is missing, this test is assumed
#            to be run only once.
#    tests: a list of instruction strings describing the tests to be
#           performed.
#    files: a list of files to collect
#    commands: a list of commands to run, each command has two keys:
#       run: the command to invoke
#       description: a description for human consumption
#       output: {single|multi|attach|exitcode|human}
#         value 'single' (default): the output is a single line
#         value 'multi': the output is multiple lines
#         value 'attach': the output should be attached as file
#         value 'exitcode': the output is the exit code of the command
#         value 'human': the output depends on human-interpretation

        This is an example yaml file. The text here is used as the file
        description in the generated markdown file. This section can contain
        normal **markdown** syntax.

        You can add

        And other things such as a [link to uji](https://github.com/whot/uji).

# First, let's define some actors. It's really up to you to decide what
# is an actor but as a general rule: it's a thing you test against.
# Since the tests will be executed against the actor itself, it pays off to
# have the actor defined as a very specific entity rather than as a
# representative of a group. IOW, use "G500s mouse" over "USB mouse".
#
# Since we support 'include:' statements, you could have files with all the
# hw you have defined in mice.yaml, keyboards.yaml, etc.

# inherits everything from above but overwrites the tags. The actor itself
# thus looks mostly the same, but since it's a different piece of HW we want
